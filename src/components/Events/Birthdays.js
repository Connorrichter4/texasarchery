					This is a 1 1/2 hour package at the indoor range with a reserved
					shooting and party area. We supply instructor and equipment for 10
					people to shoot (For ages 9 years and up) for one hour. First hour is
					shooting, balance is party celebration. Activities run through
					shooting safety, instruction, and multiple game scenarios with
					targets, balloons, etc. If a party theme, we suggest bringing a pinata
					(without candy inside) for our moving target skill challenge! You are
					welcome to bring cake/food and decorations for your celebration – just
					no alcohol please.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cost: $250 (based on 10 shooters, other guests may watch, additional
					shooters pay $20 – max 15 shooters).
